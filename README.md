# 🌟 Vibe Project Manager

> **100% Vibe Coded Project Management** ✨  
> *Built on pure intuition, caffeine, and the cosmic alignment of good vibes*

Welcome to the most organically developed project management system you've ever seen! This isn't your typical enterprise software - this is what happens when you let creativity flow and code with your heart.

## 🚀 What is Vibe Project Manager?

Vibe Project Manager is a full-stack project management application that was born from the beautiful chaos of stream-of-consciousness coding. Every feature was added based on vibes, every design decision made by feeling, and every line of code written with pure intention.

### ✨ The Vibe Stack

- 🟢 **Express.js** - Because it just feels right
- 🔐 **JWT Authentication** - Securing the vibes
- 🗄️ **Database Integration** - Storing all the good energy
- 📝 **RESTful APIs** - Clean communication flows

**Frontend (Next.js Magic):**
- ⚛️ **Next.js 15** - React with that server-side spice
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI** - Making things pretty effortlessly
- 🔄 **TypeScript** - Type safety with style
- 🌙 **Modern React Patterns** - Hooks, Context, and good vibes only

## 🌈 Features That Just Made Sense
