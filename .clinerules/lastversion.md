*** MUST *** always check latest version of packages.
*** MUST *** if you really need to access latest documentation for any package use context7, but don't always use it.
*** MUST *** Always try to use ready to use libraries over writing it yourself.
*** MUST *** Don't create large files, always create small function and import them in main libraries.
